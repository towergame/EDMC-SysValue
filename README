# SysValue  
An awfully simple and crude plugin to show the approximate system value according to EDSM's database. This works only for systems that have already been discovered and added to EDSM's database and is a very, very rough approximation to let you know which systems are worth bothering with. 

Obviously requires EDMC to function. https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector
